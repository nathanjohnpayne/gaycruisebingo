# Gate `moderateProof` (Cloud Vision) behind an off-by-default flag (`functions/src/index.ts`, `functions/src/visionGate.ts`, #126)

Cloud Vision (`moderateProof`) is part of the Phase-1 Functions backend that is intentionally not deployed yet, but the #101 email notifiers (`notifyProofModeration` / `notifyItemModeration`, merged in #120) live in the same `functions/src/index.ts` module. Firebase validates every trigger in a module at deploy-plan time, and `moderateProof` fails that validation — it is a `us-central1` `onObjectFinalized` Storage trigger, but the project's default Storage bucket is `us-east1`, and a function cannot listen to a bucket in another region. That single invalid trigger blocks deploying the whole `functions` package, so the notifiers cannot ship on their own while `moderateProof` is unconditionally exported. The human decision (2026-07-09) was to deploy the notifiers only and leave Cloud Vision deferred. This spec records the gate that makes that possible; it is guarded by `tests/functions/w4-gate-vision-moderation.test.ts` (the `test:functions` layer).

## `moderateProof` is exported only when `ENABLE_VISION_MODERATION` is `true`

`functions/src/index.ts` computes `const VISION_ENABLED = visionModerationEnabled()` at module load and assigns the `moderateProof` export conditionally: `export const moderateProof = VISION_ENABLED ? onObjectFinalized({ memory: '512MiB' }, moderateProofHandler) : undefined`. `visionModerationEnabled` (in `functions/src/visionGate.ts`) resolves the `ENABLE_VISION_MODERATION` flag from `functions/.env` / `functions/.env.<projectId>` (see the discovery-vs-runtime section below for exactly how). It defaults OFF: an absent value, or any value other than the literal string `true`, resolves to `false`.

- **Given** the flag is absent **when** the module is loaded **then** `moderateProof` is `undefined` (Cloud Vision deferred; default off). (Test: "is undefined (not exported) when the flag is absent — default OFF".)
- **Given** the flag is set to a value other than the literal string `true` (e.g. `TRUE`) **when** the module is loaded **then** `moderateProof` is still `undefined` — the check is a strict equality against `'true'`, so no other truthy-looking value turns Vision on. (Test: "is undefined when the flag is set to anything other than the literal string \"true\"" and the `visionModerationEnabled` process.env cases.)

## The flag is honored at deploy trigger discovery, not just runtime (the load-bearing mechanism)

Whether `moderateProof` is exported is decided during Firebase's **trigger discovery** — the step where firebase-tools loads the functions module and reads the endpoint manifest it exports. A naive `process.env.ENABLE_VISION_MODERATION` read at module load (which is what the first cut of #126 shipped, and equally what a `firebase-functions/params` `defineBoolean(...).value()` would do) does **not** see the operator's `functions/.env.<projectId>` value at that step, so the export could never actually flip on. This was flagged by Codex (PR #128 review) and verified against the installed toolchain:

- firebase-tools spawns the discovery subprocess with an **explicitly built, sealed environment** — `{ ...firebaseEnvs, FUNCTIONS_CONTROL_API: 'true', HOME, PATH, NODE_ENV, __FIREBASE_FRAMEWORKS_ENTRY__ }`, where `firebaseEnvs` is only `{ FIREBASE_CONFIG, GCLOUD_PROJECT }` (`node_modules/firebase-tools/lib/deploy/functions/runtimes/node/index.js` `spawnFunctionsProcess`; the env passed to `discoverBuild` in `deploy/functions/prepare.js` `loadCodebases` is `firebaseEnvs` + `GOOGLE_CLOUD_QUOTA_PROJECT`). It does **not** spread `process.env` and does **not** load the user `.env` files into it.
- `loadUserEnvs` (which reads `functions/.env[.<projectId>]`) runs **after** discovery, in `prepare.js`, only to set the deployed function's **runtime** `environmentVariables` and to resolve declared `params` — never in the discovery subprocess.
- A `firebase-functions/params` boolean is no escape hatch: `BooleanParam.runtimeValue()` reads `process.env[name]` (`functions/node_modules/firebase-functions/lib/params/types.js`), the same unset key at discovery, and the SDK warns that calling `.value()` during deployment is "usually a mistake". Params resolve for CEL **config fields** after discovery, not for a JS module-load conditional export.

What firebase-tools **does** guarantee at discovery is `cwd = the functions source dir` (`spawn(..., { cwd: this.sourceDir })`) plus `GCLOUD_PROJECT` and `FUNCTIONS_CONTROL_API=true`. So `visionModerationEnabled` reads the `.env` files itself from `cwd` at discovery: it short-circuits on `process.env.ENABLE_VISION_MODERATION` when present (the runtime and emulator path, where the platform has already injected the value), and otherwise — only when `FUNCTIONS_CONTROL_API==='true'`, i.e. during discovery — resolves the project id (`GCLOUD_PROJECT`, else `FIREBASE_CONFIG.projectId`) and reads `.env` then `.env.<projectId>` (project file overrides, mirroring firebase-tools' own precedence). Any missing/malformed file resolves to OFF; no filesystem access happens outside discovery.

This was confirmed end-to-end by driving the real firebase-functions discovery server (`FUNCTIONS_CONTROL_API=true`, sealed env, `cwd = functions/`) and reading `/__/functions.yaml`: with `ENABLE_VISION_MODERATION=true` present ONLY in `functions/.env.<projectId>` (not in the process env), `moderateProof` appears in the manifest; with the flag absent it does not; the notifiers appear in every case.

- **Given** the discovery markers (`FUNCTIONS_CONTROL_API=true`, `cwd = functions dir`, `GCLOUD_PROJECT`/`FIREBASE_CONFIG`) and `ENABLE_VISION_MODERATION=true` in `.env.<projectId>` (and NOT in `process.env`) **when** `visionModerationEnabled` runs **then** it returns `true`. (Tests: the "deploy trigger-discovery: reads functions/.env[.<projectId>] from cwd" cases — `.env.<projectId>`, plain `.env`, project-file override, `FIREBASE_CONFIG` projectId fallback, quotes/comment handling, and the no-declaration default-OFF.)
- **Given** the flag is unset AND not a discovery context (`FUNCTIONS_CONTROL_API` not `'true'`) **when** `visionModerationEnabled` runs **then** it returns `false` without touching the filesystem. (Test: "is OFF when the flag is unset outside discovery (no filesystem read)".)

## When off, Firebase never registers, validates, or deploys `moderateProof`

An `undefined` export is not a deployable CloudFunction, so Firebase's Functions export discovery skips it silently. `firebase-functions/lib/runtime/loader.js` `extractStack()` walks `Object.entries(module)` and registers an export as an endpoint only when `typeof val === 'function' && val.__endpoint && typeof val.__endpoint === 'object'`. An `undefined` export fails the very first clause of that check, so it is never added to the endpoint manifest — Firebase never sees it, never runs the region validation that would reject the `us-central1`-vs-`us-east1` mismatch, and never deploys it. With the flag off, the deploy therefore brings up the notifiers (and the #43 threshold-hide function once it lands) but not Cloud Vision, and the region mismatch cannot block the notifier deploy.

## When on, `moderateProof` is byte-behavior-identical to before the gate

The gate changes only WHETHER `moderateProof` is exported, never its behavior. When `VISION_ENABLED` is `true`, the export is the same `onObjectFinalized({ memory: '512MiB' }, …)` CloudFunction as before #126 — the handler body (thumbnail via sharp, SafeSearch flagging that flags only extreme/violent content and never raciness, the flag write-back to `events/${eventId}/proofs/${proofId}`), the `us-central1` region, and the trigger options are unchanged. The prior inline handler was extracted verbatim into a named `moderateProofHandler` function so both branches of the conditional read cleanly; nothing in the Vision or flagging logic was touched.

- **Given** the flag resolves on **when** the module is loaded **then** `moderateProof` is a defined CloudFunction — a `function` carrying the `__endpoint` manifest object that Firebase's export discovery checks for. (Test: "is a defined CloudFunction when the flag is \"true\"".)

## The #101 notifiers are always exported, regardless of the flag

The gate scopes `moderateProof` alone. `notifyProofModeration` and `notifyItemModeration` (and their shared `handleModeration` helper) are untouched by this change and stay exported whether the flag is on or off, so the notifier-only Phase-1 deploy carries them in every configuration.

- **Given** either flag state **when** the module is loaded **then** both `notifyProofModeration` and `notifyItemModeration` are still exported functions. (Test: "leaves the #101 notifiers exported and unaffected regardless of the flag".)

## Deferred deploy path

Cloud Vision stays gated off until two independent blockers are cleared, in this order: (1) enable the Cloud Vision API on the project; (2) resolve the region mismatch — `moderateProof` must run in the bucket's region, `us-east1`, not `us-central1`; (3) set `ENABLE_VISION_MODERATION=true` in `functions/.env.<projectId>`; (4) redeploy `--only functions`. Because the gate is honored at discovery (previous section), step 3 genuinely enables the export. The region fix (step 2) itself is deferred to the real Cloud Vision cutover and is documented in `functions/.env.example` and `docs/app/phase-1-deploy.md`, not applied here — this ticket changes only whether `moderateProof` is exported.

## Acceptance criteria

- **Given** the merged gate, **when** `npm run test:functions` runs, **then** `tests/functions/w4-gate-vision-moderation.test.ts` passes: the `visionModerationEnabled` gate is OFF by default and only `'true'` (via `process.env` at runtime, or `functions/.env[.<projectId>]` at discovery) turns it on; `moderateProof` is `undefined` when off and a defined `__endpoint`-bearing CloudFunction when on; and the two notifiers stay exported in both states.
- **Given** the flag is on, **when** `moderateProof` is compared to its pre-#126 definition, **then** its handler logic, region (`us-central1`), and `onObjectFinalized` options are unchanged.
