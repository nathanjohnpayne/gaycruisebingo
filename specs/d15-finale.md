# Two-beat finale: last-call standings + freeze + podium (`d15-finale`)

Implements `plans/daily-cards-spec.md` § "Scoring and social surfaces" → "The finale—two-beat finish" and § "Farewell view". The cruise ends on two scheduled beats: at **20:00 on Day 9** a last-call Moment posts the going-into-the-final-night standings; at **08:00 on Day 10** the standings **freeze** (`EventDoc.frozenAt` set), the farewell Day unlocks, and the farewell view opens with the **podium** — cruise champion, cruise-wide First to BINGO, and the ten daily honors — also posted as a final Moment. `d15-scheduler-unlock` (#202) owns firing the two beats on schedule; this ticket owns their CONTENT — the standings/podium copy and computation — and the client-side farewell podium banner + freeze semantics.

## Contract

- `functions/src/finaleContent.ts` (new, needs-phase-4) — pure, injectable content functions the scheduler's 20:00-D9 / 08:00-D10 triggers call into. No `firebase-admin`, no live backend (mirrors `unlockDay.ts`'s decoupled-pure posture):
  - `lastCallStandingsCopy(players, opts?)` — the going-into-the-final-night line ("Jess leads by 2 bingos—standings freeze at 8 a.m."), naming the leader and their margin; degrades to a generic line on a tie or an empty board.
  - `buildPodiumPayload(players, days, dayHonors)` — the podium payload: cruise champion (top of the aggregated standings, EXCLUDING the ceremonial farewell Day), cruise-wide First to BINGO (main-game Days only — never an embark/farewell-only mark), and the ten daily honors read from each Day's `meta.firstBingo`.
  - The ranking + tutorial-exclusion semantics MIRROR `src/game/logic.ts`'s `comparePlayers` / `cruiseFirstBingoAt` (the app and functions packages are deliberately decoupled, like `autohide.ts` from `moderation.ts`).
- `src/data/finale.ts` (new) — the client mirror:
  - `buildPodium(players, days)` — the same podium the scheduler posts, computed client-side from the live-but-frozen `PlayerDoc` aggregates + per-Day honors. The champion/standings EXCLUDE the farewell Day's contribution, so post-freeze farewell marks never move the podium (the farewell-is-ceremonial rule; the podium is "as of `frozenAt`", not live).
  - `farewellPinIndex(days, frozenAt, now)` — the default-view pin: the farewell Day's array index once `frozenAt` is set AND the farewell Day is unlocked, else `null` (fall back to the normal "today" default). Never pins before the freeze.
- `src/components/FarewellPodium.tsx` (new) — the farewell view's podium banner (champion + cruise-wide First to BINGO + ten daily-honor rows), rendered ABOVE the goodbye banner (`d15-tutorial-banners` owns the goodbye copy/mount; this ticket owns the podium banner and their stacking order).
- `src/components/Board.tsx` (modify) — mount the podium above the goodbye banner on the farewell Day once frozen, and pin the farewell Day as the default view once the cruise has ended (`farewellPinIndex`).
- `src/types.ts` / `src/data/converters.ts` — `EventDoc.frozenAt?: number` (ms epoch) is the freeze stamp; a missing field reads as `undefined` (unset) through `eventConverter`'s passthrough. (Landed with the #212 schema contract.)

## Acceptance criteria

- **Given** it is 20:00 on Day 9, **when** the scheduled trigger fires, **then** a last-call Moment posts naming the current leader and their margin. (Test: last-call-copy.)
- **Given** it is 08:00 on Day 10, **when** the scheduled trigger fires, **then** `frozenAt` is set, the farewell Day unlocks, and a podium Moment posts with the champion, cruise-wide First to BINGO, and ten daily honors. (Test: podium-payload.)
- **Given** the cruise has ended (`frozenAt` set) and the farewell Day is unlocked, **when** a Player opens the app, **then** the farewell Day (podium included) is the default view; before the freeze it is never pinned. (Test: default-view-pin.)
- **Given** the podium, **then** its cruise-wide First to BINGO never credits an embark- or farewell-only mark. (Test: tutorial-exclusion.)
- **Given** the podium, **then** the champion/standings are computed EXCLUDING the farewell Day, so a post-freeze farewell mark never changes the podium. (Test: ceremonial-farewell.)
- **Given** the event doc, **then** `frozenAt` is admin/Function-writable only, never client-writable directly by a Player. (Test: rules.)

## Test coverage

- `tests/functions/d15-finale.test.ts` (functions layer, `vitest.functions.config.ts`) — `lastCallStandingsCopy` names the correct leader + margin from a fixture player set and degrades on a tie/empty board; `buildPodiumPayload` excludes an embark/farewell-only first-bingo from the cruise-wide honor, excludes the farewell Day from the champion totals, and includes all ten daily honors when present.
- `src/components/FarewellPodium.test.tsx` (RTL/jsdom) — renders champion, cruise-wide First to BINGO, and ten daily-honor rows from a fixture payload, above the goodbye banner mount point.
- `src/data/d15-finale.test.ts` (Vitest unit) — `farewellPinIndex` pins only once `frozenAt` is set and the farewell Day is unlocked, never before; `buildPodium` picks the champion, excludes the ceremonial farewell Day, and excludes tutorial Days from the cruise-wide First to BINGO.
- `tests/rules/d15-finale.test.ts` (rules emulator) — `EventDoc.frozenAt` is writable by an admin/Function but rejected for a non-admin Player.
