# w2-ban-console — the Admin ban console + presentational banned-content filter (#108)

#113 (`specs/w2-banned-uids.md`) landed the rules + type contract for the Admin ban: `EventDoc.bannedUids: string[]`, the `isAdmin`-gated event-doc write path (validated as a list, size-capped at 1000, disjoint from `admins`, accepting `arrayUnion`/`arrayRemove` partial updates), and the `eventConverter` default of `[]`. This ticket is the **client consumer**: the `banUser`/`unbanUser` writes, the Admin console control, and the presentational filter that hides a banned Player's content across every PUBLIC/player surface. It changes **no** rules and **no** types — it only consumes the #113 contract.

The approved design (human-decided): `bannedUids` is a **presentational, event-scoped hide/mute** (ADR 0004 Phase 0), **NOT hard access revocation** — a banned Player can still read and write; their content is simply filtered out of other Players' views. Server-authoritative enforcement (blocking a banned uid's reads/writes) is #43/#44 and is **explicitly out of scope**. A ban is a **moderation / dispute tool, NOT anti-cheat** (ADR 0001): there is no motivated cheater in the threat model, and the ban does not make marks trustworthy — it mutes disruptive or disputed content so the group's shared surfaces stay usable with no Admin awake.

## What already shipped (consumed, not rebuilt)

- `EventDoc.bannedUids: string[]` (`src/types.ts`, #113) — the required, presentational roster. **Unchanged here.**
- `firestore.rules` — the `isAdmin`-gated event-doc `bannedUids` write path (list / `<= 1000` / disjoint-from-`admins`, validating the resulting state so `arrayUnion`/`arrayRemove` partials are accepted). `users/{uid}` stays owner-only. **Unchanged here** (pinned by `tests/rules/w2-banned-uids.test.ts`).
- `eventConverter` defaults a missing/malformed `bannedUids` to `[]` (`src/data/converters.ts`, #113). **Unchanged here.**
- `isReportHidden` (`src/data/moderation.ts`) — the sibling ADR 0004 Phase 0 community auto-hide predicate this ticket mirrors.

## The change

- `src/data/moderation.ts` — a new **exported pure predicate** `isBanned(uid, bannedUids)`: `true` iff `uid` is a non-empty string and `bannedUids` is an array containing it. It **fails OPEN** exactly like `isReportHidden` — an empty, missing (event doc loading / fresh event), or malformed (non-array) roster filters **nothing**, and an absent owner uid is never "banned". It lives in this **Firestore-free, React-free** module so BOTH the read hooks AND the deal path apply the identical test; pure, so every boundary is unit-testable.
- `src/data/admin.ts` — `banUser(uid)` / `unbanUser(uid)`: `updateDoc(events/{EVENT_ID}, { bannedUids: arrayUnion(uid) })` and `arrayRemove(uid)`. The **partial-update shape is deliberate** — it touches ONLY `bannedUids`, so a ban never clobbers other event config (`claimMode`, `defaultTheme`, `settings`, `admins`), and it is exactly the shape the #113 rules accept (they validate the resulting field state, not the diff). It writes ONLY the event doc, never owner-only `users/{uid}`. Scoped by the module-level `EVENT_ID` like `setClaimMode`/`setEventTheme` (single-event app). **Signature note:** matching the established `data/admin.ts` write style (`confirmClaim`, `setClaimMode`, … all key off `EVENT_ID`), these take only `uid` — the event is implicit, not an explicit `eventId` parameter.
- `src/hooks/useData.ts` — a combined internal `useEventModeration(enabled)` reads BOTH `threshold` and `bannedUids` from ONE `useEventDoc()` subscription (so a consumer needing both opens one event-doc listener, not two), and re-exports `isBanned` (like `isReportHidden`). The public read hooks apply `isBanned` by the content's OWNER uid (see § Filtered surfaces). `useEventModeration(false)` opens no subscription, preserving the "pass null to open no subscription" contract of `useTally`/`useDoubts`.
- `src/data/api.ts` — `joinAndDeal` reads `bannedUids` from the SAME event-doc fetch it already makes for the threshold, and drops banned-author Prompts (`createdBy`) from the deal pool with the SAME `isBanned` predicate, **before** `dealBoard` — so a frozen card is dealt from the SAME pool a Player sees live (`useItems`), and the `MIN_POOL` thin-pool guard counts the ban-visible pool.
- `src/components/Admin.tsx` — a **Ban author / Unban author** control on every report-queue row (keyed on the content owner: a Proof's `uid`, a Prompt's `createdBy`), mirroring the hide/restore/delete controls, plus a **Banned players** roster listing with an **Unban** for each — so a Player with no queued content left is still reachable to unban. The label reflects the current banned state. Admin views stay **UNfiltered** (see § Admin reachability). *Re-housed by `admin-console-ia`*: the queue-row controls live in the Review queue (`src/components/admin/ReviewQueue.tsx`) and the roster is the Players detail at `/more/admin/players` (`src/components/admin/PlayersPanel.tsx`).
- `src/components/Leaderboard.tsx` — the presentational ban filter for the VIEW only (see § Leaderboard / first-bingo split).

## Filtered surfaces (every UID-bearing PUBLIC read)

A banned uid's content is filtered by its OWNER uid off every PUBLIC/player-facing read, mirroring `isReportHidden`. All of these are PUBLIC reads; the Admin views below are deliberately left UNfiltered.

- **Prompt pool + deal** — `useItems` (filter `createdBy`) and `joinAndDeal`'s deal pool (filter `createdBy`).
- **Proof Feed** — `useProofFeed` (filter `uid`); through it the merged `useFeed` inherits the filter on its proof side.
- **Per-item Proof lookup** — `useProofsForItemText` (filter `uid`) — the Tally sheet's public "Proof shown ✓" per-marker read.
- **Tally markers** — `useTally` (filter marker `uid`); the banned marker drops from both the who-list AND the derived `count`.
- **Moments** — `useMoments` (filter `uid`); the banned Player's broadcast beats drop from the Feed.
- **Doubts** — `useDoubts` (VIEWER-AWARE): a banned accuser's Doubts (`fromUid` banned) are hidden **everywhere**, themselves included. A Doubt against a banned **target** (`targetUid` banned) is hidden from **other** viewers — but NOT from the target themselves on their own board (see § The viewer's own content). `useDoubts` therefore takes the signed-in `viewerUid` (Board threads it for both the per-Square DoubtBadge and the TallySheet) and keeps a target-banned Doubt when `targetUid === viewerUid`.

### The viewer's own content is not filtered for themselves

A ban is presentational: it hides a Player's content from OTHERS, not from themselves. Two hooks carry this own-content exception:

- `useMyProofs` — the VIEWER'S OWN active Proofs (consumed only by the viewer's own Doubt-badge derivation) is deliberately **NOT** ban-filtered, so a banned viewer's own Proofs still answer Doubts against them in their own UI. The ban takes effect on the PUBLIC-facing reads (`useProofFeed`, `useProofsForItemText`) where OTHERS see that same content.
- `useDoubts` — the target-side ban filter is **viewer-aware** (Codex P2, PR #122 round 2): a banned Player viewing their OWN board must still **see and be able to answer** a Doubt raised against them, so a Doubt whose `targetUid === viewerUid` is kept even when the target is banned. Without this, the ban would silence accusations against a banned Player in their own UI — the opposite of the `useMyProofs` exception, which lets those same Proofs satisfy the Doubt. The accuser-side (`fromUid`) filter has no such exception: a banned accuser's own Doubts are hidden from everyone, because a Doubt is content aimed at others.

## Leaderboard / first-bingo split

`useLeaderboard()` is the SHARED roster read by BOTH the Leaderboard VIEW and Board's First-to-BINGO ceremony, and the two need OPPOSITE treatment of a ban:

- **Board's First-to-BINGO** determination must read the **RAW, UNFILTERED** roster. First to BINGO is a **factual historical event** — who crossed the line first already happened. If banning removed a Player from the roster Board reads, a later Player would **retroactively become "first to BINGO"** — rewriting history. That is not intended.
- **The Leaderboard VIEW** should hide a banned Player's row.

So `useLeaderboard()` stays **RAW** — it never reads `bannedUids` — and the presentational filter lives in the **Leaderboard component**: it filters banned Players out of the displayed rows and the Share Card, but computes the First-to-BINGO **pin identity from the RAW roster**. Consequence: if the first-to-BINGO holder is banned, their row is simply hidden and **no visible row wins the "1st BINGO" badge** — a later Player is never promoted. Board, reading the raw hook, is entirely unaffected.

The regression that pins this: banning the original first-bingo Player must NOT hand the badge to a later Player (the VIEW) while `useLeaderboard` still returns the banned Player (the raw source Board reads). A test that applied the filter to the shared source instead would fail both halves.

## Admin reachability — admin views stay UNfiltered

Only PUBLIC/player reads filter. The Admin console (`useAllItems`, `useReportedProofs`, `usePendingClaims`, and the queue rows derived from them) applies **no** ban filter, so a banned Player's Prompts and Proofs stay reachable there for review, moderation, and unban — the same reachability invariant `specs/w2-admin-console.md` establishes for the threshold auto-hide. The Banned players section additionally lists every banned uid so an Admin can unban even a Player whose content has all been deleted.

## System/sentinel authors are never bannable (the pool-nuke footgun)

Not every `createdBy` is a real player uid. `scripts/seed.mjs` seeds the default Prompt pool with `createdBy: 'seed'` — a **sentinel**, not a player — on every seeded Prompt (a content-hash-keyed upsert). Because the pool filter (`useItems`) and the deal path (`joinAndDeal`) now hide Prompts by `createdBy`, banning `'seed'` would hide the **entire default pool at once**, leaving new Players with a thin/empty board — a single mis-click could nuke the game (Codex P1, PR #122).

The fix is **defense in depth**, both layers, plus a recovery asymmetry:

- **UI** — `moderation.ts` owns `SYSTEM_AUTHOR_UIDS` (today `['seed']`) and `isSystemAuthor(uid)`. The Admin console's Ban control (`BanControl`) renders **nothing** for a system author, so a seeded Prompt offers no Ban button. Extend `SYSTEM_AUTHOR_UIDS` if any other non-uid system author is ever introduced.
- **Write guard** — `banUser(uid)` **refuses** a system author: it no-ops (resolves) rather than writing, so `'seed'` can **never** enter `bannedUids` even via a leaked or programmatic call. This protects the pool regardless of the UI.
- **Recovery asymmetry** — `unbanUser(uid)` is **deliberately NOT** gated: it removes **any** uid, including a sentinel. So an admin who banned `'seed'` on a pre-fix build (or by any other means) can always recover the pool via the Banned players section's Unban. `banUser` refuses to **ADD** a sentinel; `unbanUser` will **REMOVE** one.

The other filtered surfaces are **sentinel-clean** and need no such guard: Proofs, Tally markers, Moments, and Doubts are all authored by / keyed on real player uids (a Proof's `uid`, a marker's uid, a Moment's `uid`, a Doubt's `fromUid`/`targetUid`), never a sentinel. `'Anonymous'` is only a displayName fallback (`markerDisplayName`), never a `uid`/`createdBy`, so it is not a poisoning vector either. Only the Prompt `createdBy === 'seed'` case can poison the pool, and it is closed above.

## Fellow admins are never bannable (a doomed action)

`BanControl` also renders **no Ban button when the author is a fellow admin** (its `uid` is in the event's `admins`), for the same reason it excludes system authors — Codex P2, PR #122 round 2. #113's rules **reject** any resulting `bannedUids` that overlaps `admins` (`firestore.rules`: `!bannedUids.hasAny(admins)`, pinned by `tests/rules/w2-banned-uids.test.ts`), so a Ban on an admin-authored row could only ever fail with a permission error and give the admin no useful feedback. `Admin.tsx` reads `admins` from the same event doc it already reads `bannedUids` from and threads it into `BanControl`, which suppresses the Ban path when `isSystemAuthor(uid) || admins.includes(uid)`. No write-guard is needed for the admin case (unlike the sentinel case, which the rules would otherwise ACCEPT) because the rules already fail an admin-overlap ban closed server-side; the UI suppression is the primary fix so the admin never sees a doomed action.

## Presentational, bypassable by design (ADR 0004 Phase 0)

The doc is untouched by the filter: it is a client-side `.filter` computed from the shared `bannedUids`, so every honest client agrees and it works with no Admin online. It is **bypassable by design** — a client can patch its bundle to ignore the filter and still read the (rules-permitted) content. That is acceptable under the honor-system posture (ADR 0001). **Server-authoritative enforcement — blocking a banned uid's reads/writes — is #43/#44 and is explicitly NOT attempted here.** A reviewer who "hardens" this into a server access gate has jumped the ADR 0004 phase boundary.

## Claim → test

Basename-aligned to this spec (`specs/w2-ban-console.md` → `*w2-ban-console*` under `tests/**` or `src/**/*.test.*`, matched by `check_spec_test_alignment`).

### Data layer — the predicate + the write shape

Runner: `npm test` (Vitest). Test: `src/data/w2-ban-console.test.ts`.

- `isBanned` is true only for a uid on the roster; fails **open** on an empty, missing, or malformed (non-array) roster; is false for an absent (`undefined`/`null`/empty) owner uid.
- `banUser(uid)` calls `updateDoc` on `events/{EVENT_ID}` (exactly 3 path segments — the EVENT doc, not `users/{uid}` and not a subcollection) with a payload touching ONLY `bannedUids` via `arrayUnion(uid)`.
- `unbanUser(uid)` is the `arrayRemove(uid)` twin.
- `isSystemAuthor` flags the `'seed'` sentinel (and `SYSTEM_AUTHOR_UIDS` contains it), and is false for real player uids / absent uids.
- `banUser('seed')` **refuses** — no `updateDoc`, no `arrayUnion` — so a sentinel can never enter `bannedUids` (the pool-nuke guard).
- `unbanUser('seed')` **still** removes it (`arrayRemove('seed')`) — the recovery path is not gated (the ban/unban asymmetry).

### Read hooks — the presentational filter + the raw-roster pin

Runner: `npm test` (Vitest, jsdom). Test: `src/hooks/w2-ban-console.test.tsx`.

- `useItems` drops a Prompt whose `createdBy` is banned, keeps others, and filters nothing on an empty roster (fail-open).
- `useProofFeed` drops a banned author's Proof (by `uid`).
- `useTally` drops a banned marker from the who-list AND shrinks the derived `count`.
- `useMoments` drops a banned Player's Moments (by `uid`).
- `useDoubts` (viewer-aware): from ANOTHER viewer's board, a Doubt drops when either `fromUid` OR `targetUid` is banned; on the banned Player's OWN board (`viewerUid === targetUid`), a Doubt against THEM is kept (own-content exception) while their own accusations (`fromUid` banned) and Doubts against a DIFFERENT banned target stay hidden.
- `useProofsForItemText` (the public Tally-sheet read) drops a banned author's Proof.
- `useMyProofs` (the viewer's OWN content) is NOT ban-filtered — a banned viewer still sees their own Proofs.
- `useLeaderboard` returns the RAW roster INCLUDING a banned Player — the shared First-to-BINGO source stays raw (this assertion fails if the filter is moved into the hook).

### Component — the console control + the leaderboard view

Runner: `npm test` (Vitest, jsdom). Test: `src/components/w2-ban-console.test.tsx`.

- A queue Proof row offers **Ban author**; clicking calls `banUser(proof.uid)`.
- A banned author's row shows **Unban author** and STAYS reachable (admin views unfiltered); clicking calls `unbanUser(uid)`.
- A queue Prompt row's **Ban author** calls `banUser(createdBy)`.
- A **seeded Prompt** (`createdBy === 'seed'`) renders **NO** Ban control, while a real-player Prompt DOES — the system-author exclusion.
- A row authored by a **fellow admin** renders **NO** Ban control, while a normal-player row DOES — the admin-overlap exclusion (a ban that overlaps `admins` is rejected by the rules).
- The **Banned players** section lists banned uids and **Unban** calls `unbanUser(uid)` — reachable even with no queued content; empty when no one is banned.
- Leaderboard hides a banned Player from the view and does NOT promote a later Player to **1st BINGO** (the raw-source pin, VIEW half); a baseline without the ban shows the first-to-BINGO Player with the badge.

### Rules — consumed, not changed

Runner: `npm run test:rules` (Firestore emulator). Test: `tests/rules/w2-banned-uids.test.ts` (from #113, unchanged). The `banUser`/`unbanUser` `arrayUnion`/`arrayRemove` partial-update shape is exactly what that suite already accepts; this ticket adds no rules and needs no new rules test.

## Acceptance criteria

- `banUser`/`unbanUser` write `bannedUids` on the event doc via `arrayUnion`/`arrayRemove` (partial update, never clobbering other config, never touching `users/{uid}`) — `src/data/w2-ban-console.test.ts` (+ the shape the #113 `tests/rules/w2-banned-uids.test.ts` accepts).
- A banned uid's content is filtered off every PUBLIC read — pool/deal, Proof Feed, per-item Proof lookup, Tally, Moments, Doubts — by its owner uid; an empty/absent roster filters nothing (fail-open) — `src/hooks/w2-ban-console.test.tsx`.
- The viewer's own content is not filtered for themselves — `useMyProofs` is unfiltered, and `useDoubts` keeps a Doubt against the viewer when the viewer is a banned target (own-content exception), while still hiding a banned accuser's Doubts everywhere and a banned target's Doubts from other viewers — `src/hooks/w2-ban-console.test.tsx`.
- Board's First-to-BINGO reads the RAW roster (a ban never promotes a later Player), while the Leaderboard VIEW hides the banned Player — `src/hooks/w2-ban-console.test.tsx` (raw hook) + `src/components/w2-ban-console.test.tsx` (view + no-promotion).
- The Admin console bans/unbans from the report queue and a Banned players section, and admin views stay UNfiltered so banned content is reachable for review/unban — `src/components/w2-ban-console.test.tsx`.
- A system/sentinel author (`'seed'`) is never bannable — no UI Ban control and `banUser` refuses to add it — so the default pool cannot be nuked by a mis-click; `unbanUser` still removes a sentinel for recovery (the ban/unban asymmetry) — `src/data/w2-ban-console.test.ts` (guard + asymmetry) + `src/components/w2-ban-console.test.tsx` (no control on a seeded Prompt).
- A fellow admin is never bannable — `BanControl` renders no Ban control for an author in `admins` (a ban that overlaps `admins` is rejected by the #113 rules, so it is a doomed action) — `src/components/w2-ban-console.test.tsx` (no control on an admin-authored row).
- Presentational, bypassable by design; server-authoritative enforcement deferred to #43/#44; no rules or type change — this spec + no `firestore.rules`/`src/types.ts` diff.
