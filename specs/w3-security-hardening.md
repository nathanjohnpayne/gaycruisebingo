# Security & rules hardening (`w3-security-hardening`)

A hardening pass whose main job is protecting the intentional design from a well-meaning "fix." It verifies the crawler `noindex`, adds an 18+ acceptable-use / community-guidelines page behind the auth wall, documents in the `firestore.rules` comments that the self-writable `boards/{uid}` + `players/{uid}` are intentional (ADR 0001) and that every Mark publishes to a public per-Prompt Tally (ADR 0002), and proposes closing the protected-path gap by adding the security-rules and Cloud Functions surfaces to `.github/review-policy.yml`. No behavior changes to the rules. The jsdom claims are exercised by `src/w3-security-hardening.test.tsx`; the rules documentation-guard by `tests/rules/self-writable.test.ts` (rules-emulator); both validated by `scripts/ci/check_spec_test_alignment`.

## The app serves `noindex` and exposes no public unauthenticated page (ADR 0005)

The audience is a private, noindex, 18+ friend group, so `index.html` must keep serving `robots: noindex` and nothing may be reachable without signing in — everything stays behind the auth wall (ADR 0005). This ticket verifies the meta tag and adds no public route.

- **Given** `index.html` **When** its `<head>` is scanned **Then** it contains `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />`. (Test: "index.html serves robots noindex".)

## An 18+ acceptable-use page renders behind auth and is unreachable signed out

A signed-in Player can open a community-guidelines surface that states the 18+ posture, the community expectations, and how to report a Prompt or Proof (the report path that feeds #37). It self-gates on the signed-in User — nothing renders while signed out — and is not added to the frozen tab route table. On Card it sits centered under the tally; the composition root supplies the same normal-flow affordance on every other signed-in route, avoiding the former bottom-right overlap without making Guidelines Card-only.

- **Given** a signed-in Player **When** they open the acceptable-use affordance **Then** they see the 18+ guidelines and how to report a Prompt or Proof. (Test: "AcceptableUse renders the 18+ guidelines and report path for a signed-in Player".)
- **Given** a signed-out visitor **When** `AcceptableUse` mounts **Then** it renders nothing and exposes no page (ADR 0005). (Test: "AcceptableUse renders nothing while signed out".)
- **Given** a signed-in Player on Card or any other tab **When** the route UI renders **Then** exactly one Guidelines affordance is reachable: Card mounts it under the tally and `src/main.tsx` mounts it for non-Card routes. (Test: "keeps AcceptableUse reachable on Card and every other signed-in route".)
- **Given** the reporting paths today only increment `reportCount` (`src/data/api.ts`, `src/data/proofs.ts`) and visibility only changes via an Admin action (`src/data/admin.ts`) — the threshold auto-hide is future work (#37) **When** the report-a-Prompt-or-Proof copy is read **Then** it says a report flags the item for an Admin's review and Admins can hide or remove it, and it does not claim reports hide anything automatically. (Test: "does not promise automatic report-threshold hiding".)
- **Given** a signed-in Player using a keyboard or screen reader **When** they open the guidelines dialog **Then** focus moves into the dialog, Tab/Shift+Tab stay trapped inside it while it is open, Escape closes it, and focus returns to the trigger on close via any of "Got it", the backdrop, or Escape — so the covered app chrome behind the dialog is never reachable by Tab. (Test: "moves focus into the dialog on open and restores it to the trigger when \"Got it\" closes it", "traps Tab and Shift+Tab within the dialog while it is open", "closes on Escape and restores focus to the trigger", "restores focus to the trigger when the backdrop closes the dialog".)

## The rules comments pin self-writable-by-design and Tally-publishes as intentional (ADR 0001 / 0002)

The self-writable `boards/{uid}` + `players/{uid}` are load-bearing honor-system design (ADR 0001): a Player writes their own Board and stats directly, so a lock-down "fix" is a misread. Every Mark self-publishes an attributed entry to its Prompt's public Tally (ADR 0002) while the Board stays private. The comments document this so a future reviewer does not revert it; a rules-emulator guard test-pins the intent so it is not merely commented. No rule behavior changes.

- **Given** the emulator + rules **When** an owner writes their own `boards/{uid}` or `players/{uid}` **Then** the write is ALLOWED, and a write to another Player's board or stats is DENIED. (Test: "ADR 0001: boards/players stay self-writable for the owner; cross-player writes denied".)
- **Given** a Mark **When** a Player writes their own `tally/{itemId}/markers/{uid}` entry **Then** it is ALLOWED and publicly readable, while forging another Player's entry is DENIED. (Test: "ADR 0002: a Mark publishes an attributed Tally entry; forgery denied".)

## The security-rules and functions surfaces are proposed as protected paths

`firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`, and `functions/**` gate every client's access, so a change to them should always draw external (Phase 4) review regardless of line count. This ticket adds them to `external_review_paths` in `.github/review-policy.yml`, closing the protected-path gap the parallelization plan names.

- **Given** `.github/review-policy.yml` **When** `external_review_paths` is read **Then** it lists `firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`, and `functions/**`. (Test: "review-policy.yml protects the security-rules and functions surfaces".)
