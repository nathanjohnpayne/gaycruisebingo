# admin-async-feedback — pending/error feedback on the moderation click handlers

Implements #411 (deferred from PR #410's review): the admin moderation row actions fired async `data/admin` writes with no local catch or pending state — a rejected write (offline at sea, a rules denial) gave the admin no feedback and surfaced as an unhandled promise rejection. Every such action now disables while its write is in flight and surfaces a rejected write inline, in the spirit of `SchedulePanel`'s `UnlockNowButton`/`ResnapshotButton`. **No write path changes** — this wraps the exact calls the console already made.

## Contract

- `src/components/admin/AsyncButton.tsx` (new) — the shared affordance: a button that runs an async `onAction`, disables while pending, and on rejection renders an inline `.pill.pill-error` alert (`role="alert"`, default copy "Failed — try again."). The button re-enables after a failure — tapping again retries and clears the pill; success clears everything (including the common case where the row unmounts because the subscription removed it). Presentation props (`className`, `title`, `ariaLabel`, children) pass through, so existing selectors and accessible names are unchanged.
- `src/components/admin/ReviewQueue.tsx` — every row action runs through `AsyncButton`: Clear reports / Hide / Restore / Delete on report rows (both kinds), Ban author / Unban author (`BanControl`), Approve / Reject / Approve all on approvals, Confirm / Reject on claims.
- `src/components/admin/PromptPool.tsx` — Hide / Restore / Delete run through `AsyncButton`. The curated add form keeps its existing `busy` state and now surfaces a rejected add inline ("Didn’t add — try again."), keeping the draft text for a one-tap retry. A rejected inline text save keeps the editor OPEN with the draft intact and an inline alert ("Didn’t save — try again.") instead of silently closing as if committed — one failure state serves both commit paths (the Save button and Enter in the input).
- `src/components/admin/PlayersPanel.tsx` — Unban runs through `AsyncButton`.
- `src/index.css` — `.pill-error`, the failure accent on the existing `.pill` chrome.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given a moderation write that rejects, the acting control shows an inline `role="alert"` failure pill and the promise never escapes unhandled; tapping the control again retries and clears the pill.
- Given a moderation write in flight, its control is disabled — a double-tap cannot fire the write twice.
- Given a rejected inline prompt-text save, the editor stays open with the draft intact.
- Given a successful write, no residual pending or error state remains.

## Test coverage

`src/components/admin-async-feedback.test.tsx` (RTL-jsdom, basename-aligned): a rejecting delete shows the alert pill and a retry clears it on success; the control disables while a write is pending and re-fires only once; a rejected claim Confirm alerts in the Review queue; a rejected Unban alerts in Players; a rejected add keeps the draft with the add-specific alert; a rejected text save keeps the editor open with the draft.
