set -euo pipefail

# Canonical deploy wrapper for projects that use op-firebase-deploy.
#
# Enforces three guards before calling the deploy chain:
#   1. Current branch is `main`.
#   2. Local `main` is not behind `origin/main`.
#   3. The working tree is clean (no modified or staged paths).
#
# These three guards together prevent the stale-worktree class of deploy
# (documented in https://github.com/nathanjohnpayne/mergepath/issues/77):
# an agent working in a feature branch, stale worktree, or with
# uncommitted in-progress edits accidentally deploying a dist/ output
# that does not match what reviewers have seen merged on main.
#
# After the guards pass, the script:
#   - Builds (default: `npm run build`; configurable via $BUILD_CMD).
#     The build command is run under `bash -euo pipefail -c --` so a
#     compound command (e.g. `npm run lint && npm run build`) fails
#     closed if any step errors, rather than masking earlier failures
#     behind the exit code of the final segment.
#   - Deploys (`op-firebase-deploy`; any arguments after `--` are passed
#     through, e.g. `--only hosting`).
#   - Purges Cloudflare cache (if CF_API_TOKEN + CF_ZONE_ID are set).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/deploy.sh                       # full deploy from main
#   scripts/deploy.sh -- --only hosting     # scope the op-firebase-deploy call
#   scripts/deploy.sh --force               # bypass branch + freshness guards
#   scripts/deploy.sh --skip-build          # assume dist/ is already built
#   scripts/deploy.sh --skip-cf-purge       # skip the Cloudflare purge step
#
# Environment:
#   BUILD_CMD            Build command (default: "npm run build").
#   CF_API_TOKEN         Cloudflare API token with Purge Cache permission.
#                        Typical source: 1Password (op read ...).
#   CF_ZONE_ID           Cloudflare zone ID for the project domain.
#   DEPLOY_ALLOW_DIRTY   Set to "1" to bypass the clean-working-tree guard.
#                        Break-glass only — never set during routine deploys.
#                        See DEPLOYMENT.md § Deploy guards.

have seen in merged PRs. Worktrees and feature branches are routinely
behind main and will silently ship stale builds (see mergepath#77).

the class of failure this guard closes).
