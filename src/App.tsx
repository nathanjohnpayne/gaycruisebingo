  // mapping exhaustive at compile time: adding a tab to `TABS` without a
  // matching page here fails `npm run typecheck`. Wave-1+ tickets change
  // what THEIR tab renders inside their own component file, not this map.
  //
  // Card is this ticket's exception: the client-driven deal (ADR 0001) used to
  // fail into a swallowed `.catch`, leaving a blank Board. A failure — most
  // often the ADR-0003/0004 pool-below-24 guard — now renders the retry surface
  // AS the Card tab's content, scoped there so the shell, Nav, and every other
  // route stay mounted while the error is up (Codex P2). `AuthContext` owns the
  // deal + error state.
  //
  // #434: on a CONNECTION-class deal failure, PREFER this device's latest durable
  // card snapshot over the full-screen reload screen. A Player who was already
  // dealt in still sees their card (read-only, refreshing in the background via
  // Retry) instead of a dead-end — the exact "it should be cached and load in the
  // background" ask. `loadCardSnapshot` is a synchronous localStorage read (no
  // network), scoped to this event + uid; Board writes the snapshot whenever it
  // paints a real card.
  //
  // Gated on `dealErrorReason === 'connection'` and AuthContext's explicit render
  // authorization so the fallback NEVER hides an actionable error and never uses a
  // saved card as proof-of-18+. A pool-shortfall keeps its own DealError ("ask an
  // admin to add prompts", which PoolRecoveryWatcher also auto-recovers on the
  // reason). This mirrors the #403 swallow, which excludes pool-shortfall for the
  // same reason. The full DealError also stays for a genuine first-timer with
  // nothing cached.
  //
  // Phase 1.5 (#203): Prompts (ItemPool) and Admin are no longer routed,
  // tab-driven pages — they mount inside the More tab's menu (#208), not the
  // route table. The set is Card · Feed · Ranks · More.
