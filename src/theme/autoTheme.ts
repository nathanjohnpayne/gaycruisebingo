/**
 * Resolve "today's Day" from `EventDoc.days` for the More menu's Theme row
 * (daily-cards-spec § "More menu" — "Auto: match the day"): board chrome
 * already follows the VIEWED Day (a future ticket, #205); Auto makes the
 * WHOLE APP follow TODAY'S Day instead of a manual pick.
 *
 * "Today's Day" is the last Day whose `unlockAt` has passed relative to
 * `now` — a Day is "current" from its own unlock moment (which may be mid-
 * morning) until the NEXT Day's unlock, not by calendar date alone. Ties on
 * `unlockAt` break to the lowest `index`, the SAME tie-break as the
 * pre-unlock fallback below, so the resolved theme cannot flip at the
 * boundary the moment a tied pair unlocks (Codex P2 on #303). Before
 * the first Day's `unlockAt` (pre-cruise), the FIRST Day — earliest
 * `unlockAt`, ties broken by lowest `index` — is already what the whole app
 * presents (the Board's `defaultViewedIndex` falls back to Day 0, the header
 * reads the embark Day), so Auto resolves to that first Day's theme rather
 * than the event default (#299: Auto painted Neon Playground while every
 * other surface said Welcome Aboard). Only with no `days` configured (or no
 * Event yet) is there genuinely nothing to match: returns `null` so the
 * caller (ThemeContext's `autoThemeId` prop) falls back to the event/player
 * default instead of guessing.
 *
 * Pure and Firestore-free (like the rest of `theme/`) so it is unit-testable
 * without mounting a component or opening a subscription; `main.tsx` is the
 * one caller, handing the resolved id down to `ThemeProvider`.
