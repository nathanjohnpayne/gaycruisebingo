 *    loading or absent (the `eventConverter` defaults a missing field to `[]`) so
 *    `isBanned` filters nothing until a real roster arrives.
 *
 * Both are reads of SHARED config, not per-client knobs — the hides are bypassable
 * by design (a client can patch its bundle to ignore them); tamper-proof server
 * enforcement is deferred to #43/#44. Combined into one hook so a consumer that
 * needs both opens a SINGLE event-doc subscription rather than two.
 *

 * useDoubts) passes `false` when its own id is null so it opens NO subscription at
 * all — preserving those hooks' "pass null to open no subscription" contract. When
 * disabled the config reads as unset (threshold `undefined`, bannedUids `[]`), which
