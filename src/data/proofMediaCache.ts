// proofMediaCache — the single source of truth for how proof media is cached
// client-side (#363). Zero-dependency on purpose: vite.config.ts imports these
// constants to build the service worker's runtime-caching route, so this module
// must never pull in firebase (or anything browser-only) at import time.
//
// Proof media is immutable by construction: each object lives at
// proofs/{eventId}/{uid}/{proofId}.{ext} — a path unique per Proof that is
// never rewritten (deleteProof removes it, nothing overwrites it) — so a
// long-lived immutable cache policy can never serve a stale proof. Avatars are
// deliberately NOT covered by any of this: avatars/{uid}.jpg is overwritten in
// place on every profile-photo change, so long-lived caching would pin the old
// photo (see uploadAvatar in ./storage.ts).
