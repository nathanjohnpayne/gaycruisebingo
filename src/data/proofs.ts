 * (ADR 0001): it enriches the Feed, it does not make the Mark more trustworthy.
 *
 * Online-only, by design AND by rule (ADR 0006) — unlike a bare honor Mark
 * (`setMark`), attachProof does NOT queue offline:
 *   - it runs in a `runTransaction`, which needs a server round-trip and REJECTS
 *     offline (the read-modify-write folds onto the LIVE board/player so a
 *     concurrent admin resolve / another of the owner's tabs isn't clobbered),
 *     and
 *   - a photo/audio proof is unwritable before its media exists: firestore.rules
 *     pins `storagePath`/`mediaURL` to the EXACT uploaded Storage object, and a
 *     Storage upload needs signal — so a media proof doc can't be queued ahead of
 *     its upload. (A text proof carries no media, but still rides the same
 *     rejecting transaction.)
 * The offline-durable path is therefore the bare honor Mark; the Proof and its
 * media attach when connectivity returns (ADR 0006: "marks queue, proof media
 * doesn't"). Capture-then-retry lives in `ProofSheet`: a failed submit keeps the
 * captured blob/text in component state so the Player retries without
 * re-capturing — durable for the session, NOT across a reload (only the honor
 * Mark survives a reload).
 *
 * The proof→cell link is authoritative in the proof DOC (`uid` + `cellIndex`),
 * which this writes; `cells[i].proofId` is only a denormalized projection a
 * queued bare-Mark drain can wholesale-replace and drop
 * (specs/w1-board-mark-win.md § cross-writer). This is what discharges that
 * constraint for proof-capture: the Feed (`ProofFeed`/`useProofFeed`) renders
 * every entry from this doc, never from `cells`, so a dropped `proofId` never
 * removes a Proof from the Feed. `deleteProof` looks the backing cell up by
 * this same `cellIndex` rather than scanning for `proofId` — equivalent to the
 * scan given `proofId`'s uniqueness, so this is a clarity change, not a new
 * protection; see its own comment for what it does and does not do once a
 * drain has actually clobbered the projection.
