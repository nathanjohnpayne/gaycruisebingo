 * stratified deal, and increment the Player's cruise-wide `reshufflesUsed`.
 * Nothing else — and that is the point of the pristine constraint, not an
 * omission. A card with zero Marks has produced nothing: no Tally entries to
 * retract, no Proofs to pull from the Feed, no Doubts to dissolve, no stats to
 * re-fold, no Moments at risk. So there is deliberately NO cascade code here. A
 * Player who wants out of a card they HAVE marked unmarks it themselves through
 * the existing, tested Mark path (which already removes its Tally entries), which
 * returns the card to pristine — the cascade performed by the player, visibly,
 * through mechanics that already exist.
 *
 * ONLINE-ONLY, unlike every other write in this file — and enforced by
 * `runTransaction`, NOT by the `online` gate on the chip and NOT by awaiting a
 * batch. That distinction is the whole point, and getting it wrong is subtle
 * enough that the first cut of this function did (Codex P1 on #383):
 *
 * `setMark` is deliberately a fire-and-forget `writeBatch` because a batch QUEUES
 * durably offline (ADR 0006) — a Mark made in a ship-wifi dead zone must survive.
 * A reshuffle needs the exact opposite, and a batch cannot give it: offline, the
 * batch is still persisted and applied OPTIMISTICALLY to the local cache while its
 * commit promise merely pends forever. Awaiting it does not prevent the queue; it
 * just never resolves. So the Player would see the replacement card, start marking
 * it, and only later — when the drain hits a server that now denies the write
 * (another tab marked the old card; the Day rolled) — have it rolled back
 * underneath them, with any offline Mark computed against a card that never
 * existed. `navigator.onLine` cannot close that window either: it reports the
 * link, not reachability, and captive ship wifi reads as online (see useOnline).
 *
 * `runTransaction` is the primitive whose failure mode matches the contract: it
 * REQUIRES a server round trip and REJECTS offline rather than buffering, so a
 * reshuffle either lands atomically against fresh server state or fails loudly and
 * changes nothing. Its re-read on contention is a bonus: two tabs racing a
 * reshuffle re-run against the committed counter instead of double-spending, and
 * the rules' `getAfter()` pairing works inside a transaction exactly as in a batch.

 * Toggle a Square and write the Board + the Player's denormalized stats.

 * Client-authoritative (ADR 0001) and offline-queueable (ADR 0006). Deliberately
 * a plain batched write, NOT a `runTransaction`: a transaction needs a server
 * round-trip and REJECTS while offline, so a Mark made in a ship-wifi dead zone
 * would be dropped instead of queuing durably in the persistent local cache. A
 * Board is single-writer by design — only its owner writes `boards/{uid}` and
 * `players/{uid}` (firestore.rules) — but that does NOT make the caller's
 * render-time `cells` snapshot safe to fold onto blind: two Marks issued in
 * quick succession (two fast taps, or another of the owner's own tabs) fire
 * before the live listener has re-rendered the caller with the first Mark, so
 * both would fold onto the SAME stale `cells` and the second write's full-array
 * replacement would silently clobber the first — no other writer is needed for
 * that race, just the same owner acting twice before their own echo lands.
 * Two mechanisms close it together: `getDocFromCache` — a cache-only read
 * (works offline, no server round trip) that sees this client's own
 * just-applied mutations and, via the shared persistent multi-tab cache,
 * another tab's already-synced ones — folds onto the freshest LOCAL knowledge
 * of the Board (and, for `firstBingoAt`, the Player row) rather than a
 * potentially-stale prop; and the per-board serialization chain below, which
 * keeps OVERLAPPING calls from both reading that cache before either has
 * issued its batch (Codex P1, PR #75). Each
 * falls back to its caller-supplied param only when nothing is cached yet
 * (this write is the first local knowledge of the doc, e.g. a test double
 * with no cache). Both docs go in one `writeBatch` so they queue and apply
 * atomically. A bare Mark writes ONLY these two docs — nothing to the Feed
 * (moments/proofs), per ADR 0002.
 *
 * `commit()` is intentionally not awaited: offline it resolves only on a server
 * ack that may never come in this tab's lifetime, while the write lands in the
 * local cache synchronously (latency compensation) and the live listener
 * reflects it at once — awaiting would stall the Mark on the network. The caller
 * gets the win-detection result synchronously from the local compute.

// clobbering each other exactly like the stale-prop race the cache read
// closed (Codex P1, PR #75). setMark therefore serializes per board: each

// (a double-tap, a fast re-submit) so the pool doesn't get spammed by an
// enthusiastic or fat-fingered Player. It is trivially bypassable by a
// motivated caller (a second tab, a raw network call) and is NOT a security
// boundary; server-authoritative rate limiting (a Function or rules-enforced
// quota) is a Phase 1 concern — the same deferral ADR 0004 makes for the
// reactive-moderation hide. Module-scope state is fine for a client-only
// guard, same as `markChains` above — `Date.now()` is allowed in app code.
// Keyed by a caller-supplied string (`ItemPool.tsx` keys by
// `${action}:${uid}`) rather than one global bucket, so two different
// signed-in identities sharing a browser never share a throttle window.
