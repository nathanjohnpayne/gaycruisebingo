 * - `undefined` (the event doc still loading, or the setting unset) → NO filtering.
 * - `0`, a negative number, or `NaN` → NO filtering. A non-positive threshold would

 *   Feed/pool from one admin typo (Codex P2, PR #107 finding 2); requiring
 *   `threshold > 0` closes that, and the same guard rejects `NaN` (`NaN > 0` is
 *   false) even though `typeof NaN === 'number'`.
 * - any non-number → NO filtering.
 *
 * The filter fails OPEN unless the threshold is positive, because wrongly blanking
 * the whole app for everyone is worse than briefly showing a heavily-reported item,
 * and the Admin report queue is the backstop either way. Pure so the at/over/below
 * boundary AND the non-positive boundary are unit-testable without a subscription.
