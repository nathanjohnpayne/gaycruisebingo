// Client-side PostHog (product analytics) — runs ALONGSIDE GA4 (#96).
//
// Full capture is ENABLED (this reverses the prior privacy lockdown, at the
// owner's request). PostHog now autocaptures clicks, SPA pageviews + pageleaves,
// heatmaps, and records sessions — on top of the explicit named events that flow
// through analytics.ts's `track()`. Identity is still by uid only (no PII person
// properties).
//
// This is a noindex, 18+ app whose play surface is public to any logged-in
// Player. Session replay + autocapture record everything (including Proof media,
// typed inputs, and display names) UNMASKED, by owner decision: the owner is the
// sole PostHog viewer and uses replays to find UX issues, so content masking is
// deliberately not applied. The one exception is URL hygiene — captured URLs are
// reduced to path-only (see `sanitizeUrls`) so query-string credentials (e.g.
// Firebase auth-handler OAuth params) never land in analytics, matching the app's
// long-standing path-only pageview stance. This reverses the #96 privacy lockdown
// at the owner's request; ConsentNotice.tsx discloses that session replay is used.
