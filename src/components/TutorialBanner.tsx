 * mounts this ONE component above the grid, gated on the viewed Day's
 * `tutorial` flag; it renders nothing for any of the eight main Days. Which
 * of the two banners shows is read off `day.pool` (`'embark'` |
 * `'farewell'`) rather than `day.index`, so the banner tracks the seeded
 * data (#207's `DAYS`) instead of assuming the tutorial Days sit at fixed
 * positions.
 *
 * Deliberately distinct from the first-open coach overlay (#214, not yet
 * landed): that overlay only decodes the badge notation (Tally count, 👀
 * Doubt badge, ＋ add-proof, free space); this banner carries the game's
 * narrative. They complement rather than repeat, per the spec's "First-open
 * coach overlay" section — this ticket does not touch that overlay.
