/**
 * The durable-cache fallback for the Card tab (#434). When the client-driven
 * deal fails (offline, flaky ship wifi) BUT this device has a saved card
 * snapshot, App renders THIS read-only view of that card instead of the
 * full-screen "we couldn't deal your card" reload screen — so a Player who was
 * already dealt in still sees their squares, with a background Retry, rather
 * than a dead-end. The full reload screen (DealError) is reserved for a genuine
 * first-timer with nothing cached.
 *
 * Read-only on purpose: marking, Tally, and Doubts all need the LIVE board and
 * its writers, which the interactive <Board/> takes back over the instant the
 * deal recovers (`dealError` clears) and App swaps this out. This view only has
 * to answer "what does my card look like?" from the last snapshot, so it paints
 * the grid, the Day header, and the marked count — no live subscriptions, no
 * badges, no tap handlers.
