/**
 * The Admin console's manual "unlock now" fallback (#249, daily-cards-spec §
 * "Unlock mechanics": "a manual admin 'unlock now' button covers function
 * failure"). Renders ONLY inside a `ScheduleRow` whose Day is
 * `dayDueForManualUnlock` — a Day that's still locked, or already
 * snapshot-stamped, has nothing for this button to fix. Calls
 * `unlockDayNow`, the SAME admin-gated callable the 08:00/20:00 scheduler
 * beats invoke internally, so a forced unlock can never diverge from the
 * scheduled path's semantics; the Admin-gate itself is enforced server-side
 * (the callable throws `permission-denied` for a non-admin uid) — this
 * button only ever renders inside the Schedule surface, which the enclosing
 * `Admin` component already gates on `isAdmin` before mounting ANY section,
 * so there's no separate client-side admin check to duplicate here.
 *
 * `visible` (the parent's live `dayDueForManualUnlock`) controls only the
 * BUTTON itself, not the whole component: once a click lands, the
 * already-subscribed `useEventDoc` listener refreshes `day.snapshotItemIds`
 * and `visible` flips false almost immediately (an emulator/production round
 * trip is fast) — if that unmounted this component entirely, an admin would
 * see the "Unlocked." confirmation for at most a flicker, or not at all, on
 * the SAME success it needed the confirmation for. So this stays mounted
 * (`ScheduleRow` always renders it) and keeps showing its last result
 * message even after `visible` goes false; only a truly untouched (`idle`)
 * row that has scrolled out of "due" renders nothing.
