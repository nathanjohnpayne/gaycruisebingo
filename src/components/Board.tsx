/**
 * The tap-to-see-who list for a Prompt's Tally (ADR 0002): names EVERY Player who
 * marked the Prompt — no anonymity — chronologically. Reuses the proof-capture
 * sheet chrome. Markers carry no photo (the marker doc is just uid + displayName +
 * markedAt), so the avatar is the name's initial.
 *
 * It is also where a Doubt is RAISED (ADR 0001, #33): each OTHER Player's row
 * carries a "pics or it didn't happen" affordance that raises a Doubt against
 * their Mark of this Prompt; the header summarizes the open-Doubt total across the
 * markers listed below (deliberately UN-scoped per target, unlike the per-target
 * Square badge — this sheet already lists everyone by name, so an aggregate here is
 * a heat summary, not a personal accusation). A row whose Doubt(s) have been
 * answered by a Proof renders a distinct SATISFIED state, an open one a distinct
 * DOUBTED state — social pressure applied then visibly cooled. A Doubt never
 * blocks, unmarks, or discounts the Mark (never a gate), so nothing here changes
 * the Board; the doubter's own row offers no affordance (no self-doubt).
 *
 * Review-hardening details (Codex P2, PR #106 rounds 1–2):
 *  - Dormant-when-unmarked (finding 2): the open-Doubt header counts ONLY Doubts
 *    whose target is a CURRENT marker. A Doubt doc is never deleted when its target
 *    unmarks (no cross-writer cleanup); instead it goes dormant and reappears in
 *    the count if they re-mark — the accusation targets a standing Mark.
 *  - No double-raise (finding 1): the raise button disables SYNCHRONOUSLY on the
 *    first tap (a per-target in-flight ref, so a rapid second tap in the same tick
 *    is inert), cleared when the write settles; the echoed Doubt keeps it "Doubted"
 *    meanwhile, and `raiseDoubt` is passed the open set so a duplicate that slips
 *    through post-echo is also skipped at the data layer.
 *  - Item-scoped proofs (finding 4): satisfaction for the markers listed here reads
 *    the active Proofs for THIS Prompt only (`useProofsForItemText`, mounted with
 *    the sheet), not a Board-wide proof stream.
 *  - Once-only per target (round 2 finding 2): a marker this Player has ALREADY
 *    doubted — open OR satisfied — keeps the affordance disabled ("Doubted"): the
 *    deterministic doubt slot makes a re-raise in place structurally denied, so
 *    the button never offers a write the rules would reject. A fresh demand after
 *    a satisfying Proof is a retract-then-re-raise flow (the doubter's delete is
 *    already allowed by the rules), deliberately not surfaced here.
 *  - Identity-gated accusation (round 2 finding 3): the raise affordance is
 *    DISABLED until the viewer's saved identity is KNOWN (the same `identityKnown`
 *    tri-state setMark and the Moment broadcasts gate on) — a Doubt stores the
 *    accuser's name PERMANENTLY, so waiting beats stamping 'Anonymous'; the
 *    data layer's cached-row fallback (raiseDoubt) is the defense-in-depth.

  //     can still drop it; documented residual.)
  //   • Roster (first_bingo only, PR #99 finding 2): claim the ceremonial event
  //     singleton only against a SERVER-CONFIRMED roster showing no OTHER Player
  //     with an earlier bingo; while unconfirmed the candidate stays HELD (not
  //     cleared). The per-Player bingo/blackout do NOT wait on the roster.

  // win against the freshest board it has. `cellsOverride` lets the completing
  // action pass its own folded `res.cells` (doMark) — the authoritative
  // post-action state, since the render-current snapshot has usually not echoed
  // yet at that point; gate-open and snapshot drains use the render-current
  // attributable cells instead. hasBingo/isBlackout are recomputed, and a
  // NON-EMPTY attributable board is required before ANY publish: isBlackout([])

  // round 3 finding B) is load-bearing again on this path.

  // would race the latency-compensation echo — a gate can open in the window

  // pre-action — and re-lose held wins, the exact #104 bug class. The CLEARS for
  // fallen wins belong to the observers of the fall: doMark's unmark verdict and
  // the cells effect's passive falling edge (both via dropPendingWins, which also
