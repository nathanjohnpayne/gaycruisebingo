 * which is exactly why this dialog exists anyway. What it protects is not the
 * board but the ALLOWANCE: three per cruise, non-refundable, and the card is gone
 * for good. So the copy leads with permanence rather than consequence, and "Keep
 * my card" is the primary while "Reshuffle it" carries the danger styling — the
 * safe choice is the prominent one, because the risky choice here is irreversible
 * and the player is one tap from spending a third of their cruise budget.
 *
 * Copy is verbatim from the wireframe; it is asserted word-for-word by
 * src/components/reshuffle-sheet.test.tsx and the e2e parity walk.
