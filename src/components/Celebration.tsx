  // used to open its OWN `useBoard(uid)` listener and read `board?.cells ??
  // []`, which starts unset until that subscription's first snapshot
  // arrives — a fast Share tap could render and share a ZERO-CELL card even
  // though Board already had the real cells (its `!board` early-return
  // guarantees a loaded board before <Celebration> ever renders). Taking
  // the prop instead removes the race structurally: there is no second

  // and `null` otherwise (Codex P2, PR #111 round 2 finding 1 — the identity
  // twin of the cells race above). Celebration used to run its own
  // `useMyPlayer(uid)` listener + resolveDisplayName, which starts `data:
  // null` on mount, so an immediate Share tap resolved the STALE auth
  // (Google) name for a returning Player with a saved custom name — exactly
  // the window in which Board's doMark deliberately withholds the name from
  // Tally markers. `null` here means "not yet known": the Share affordance
  // is disabled below (mirroring how the Moment broadcasts HOLD until the
  // identity gate opens) rather than ever stamping the auth fallback onto a
  // card. In practice the gate is belt-and-braces: identityKnown is true in
  // every online flow long before a win can be marked (the player-row
  // subscription resolves at app start); the reachable-null window is an
  // offline reload whose persistent cache holds the board but not the
  // player row (see Board.tsx's knownFirstBingoAt comment). The card
  // renders no avatar (BingoShareCardData has no photo field), so only the

  // EAGER pre-render (Codex P2, PR #111 round 2 finding 2): rasterization
  // starts at MOUNT — the card's data is fixed by then — not at tap time. A
  // tap-time `await renderBingoShareCard(...)` could outlive the browser's
  // transient user-activation window on a slow device, making the later
  // `navigator.share` reject NotAllowedError (which the cancellation
  // classifier treats as terminal): the tap would do NOTHING — no sheet, no
  // fallback. With the render pre-started, the tap awaits a
  // usually-already-settled promise and `navigator.share` runs within the
  // activation window. The effect re-keys on the card's inputs, so a
  // late-arriving Event name re-renders the card once rather than baking
  // the stale fallback in. The `.catch(() => null)` lives INSIDE the cached
  // promise: a render failure (unsupported environment, html-to-image
  // throwing, or the 25-cell validity gate refusing a malformed board)
  // resolves to null — never an unhandled rejection when the Player closes
  // without ever tapping Share — and shareCardBlob then degrades to the
  // text/URL leg rather than ever sharing an empty/partial grid.
  //
  // `cardReady` completes the design (Codex P2, PR #111 round 3 finding 1):
  // pre-starting the render narrows the race but a tap can still land while
  // the mount render is UNSETTLED on a slow phone — the tap's await then
  // burns the activation window all the same. So the Share button stays
  // DISABLED until the cached promise SETTLES (resolved blob OR the caught
  // null — "settled", not "blob exists": a failed render must still enable
  // the button so the text/URL fallback stays reachable). A tap can then
  // only ever await an already-settled promise, keeping navigator.share
  // inside its activation window structurally. Visually this reuses the
  // exact identity-gate disable (round 2 finding 1). The `cardBlob.current
  // === promise` check keeps a STALE effect's settle (inputs changed, a new
  // render is in flight) from opening the gate for the newer render.
