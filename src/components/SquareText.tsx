/**
 * A non-free Square's prompt text (#215, specs/d15-text-size.md): the S/M/L
 * auto-fit guard that always wins over the chosen base size. `.cell`'s own
 * `font-size` (index.css, `clamp(...) * var(--text-scale)`) is the CEILING
 * this reads via `getComputedStyle` — the Player's S/M/L pick, already
 * viewport-clamped by CSS — never the floor: this span's own inline
 * `font-size` is what a Square actually renders text at, and it only ever
 * shrinks that ceiling down, never grows past it ("Large is a ceiling,
 * never an overflow"). Re-measures whenever the prompt text or the live
 * `textSize` pick changes (a pick applies `data-text-size` to `<html>`
 * SYNCHRONOUSLY inside `useTextSize`'s `setState`, ahead of the React
 * notify, so the CSS custom property has already updated by the time this
 * effect re-runs and re-reads the computed ceiling). A cell not yet laid
 * out (`getBoundingClientRect` reporting 0x0 pre-first-paint) is left at
 * the unshrunk ceiling — `fitTextSize` itself treats a zero-area box as
 * "nothing to measure against yet" — so a Square never flashes at a
 * shrunk size before its real box is known.
 *
 * Extracted from Board (#434) so the read-only CachedCardFallback can reuse
 * the SAME fitting guard rather than rendering a bare span that would clip a
 * long prompt at the Large text setting — Firebase-free deps only, so it stays
 * out of the fallback's (and this module's) import graph.
