/**
 * The one-time launch announcement for Reshuffle (#378,
 * plans/daily-cards-wireframes.html #frame-launch-intro).
 *
 * A launch beat, NOT a tutorial: it fires once, on the first open after the
 * feature deploys, and is replayable nowhere. That is the deliberate difference
 * from `CoachOverlay`, which this borrows its whole shape from — the coach
 * overlay explains the card and therefore earns a More → "How to play" replay
 * entry, while this one announces a change to players who were already mid-cruise
 * when it shipped. Once seen, it has done its job; a permanent replay affordance
 * for "new today" would be stale by Day 4.
 *
 * The storage key is the ticket's (`gcb.seen.reshuffleIntro`) rather than this
 * repo's prevailing `gcb.<feature>.dismissedAt` shape. Kept as specified so the
 * spec, the test, and the deployed key cannot drift from each other; the
 * divergence is called out in the PR as an observation rather than silently
 * "corrected" here.
