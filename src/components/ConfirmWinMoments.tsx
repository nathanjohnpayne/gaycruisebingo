/**
 * The confirm-path Moment emitter (issue #41 — the deferred PR #99 finding 6).
 *
 * In `admin_confirmed` Claim Mode a Mark starts PENDING and is excluded from the
 * win mask (`game/logic`: `marked && status !== 'pending'`), so an `attachProof`
 * in that mode crosses no win transition — Board's action-path broadcast
 * (`broadcastWinVerdict`, PR #104/#110) intentionally emits nothing at attach time
 * (a pending claim can be REJECTED and a Moment is immutable). The win — and its
 * Moment — materialize only when an Admin CONFIRMS the Claim: `resolve()`
 * (src/data/admin.ts) flips the cell `pending → confirmed` and recomputes the
 * winner's stats. But that confirm can land while the winning Player is off the
 * Card route (Board unmounted) or offline, so Board's route-scoped machinery never
 * sees it. Left unaddressed, the leaderboard and stats update while the Feed
 * silently misses the win.
 *
 * This component closes that gap. It is mounted ONCE at the app shell — OUTSIDE the
 * tab Routes — so it runs wherever the Player is. It watches the Player's OWN
 * Claims (`useMyClaims`, a `where('uid','==',uid)`-scoped read the rules permit),
 * notices when one flips to `confirmed`, waits for the confirm's board write to
 * reflect the flip, and emits the SAME Moment(s) the live edge would have —
 * attributed to the WINNER (the claim owner), NEVER the confirming Admin, and
 * written as the winner (`isOwner` create), so it needs no rules change.
 *
 * Four properties, mirroring the #110 live pipeline (Codex #116 review):
 *   1. TRANSITION-GATED (finding 1). `planConfirmBroadcasts` emits only what the
 *      just-confirmed cells CROSSED (measured against the board with those cells
 *      forced back to pending) — a confirm that completes no new line, or one made
 *      while a bingo already stood, emits nothing.
 *   2. DRAIN-UNTIL-EMPTY (finding 2). The witness read is async; a second confirm
 *      arriving while it is in flight is enqueued and the drain re-runs on settle
 *      until the queue is empty, so no confirm is stranded.
 *   3. FRESH-CONFIRM WITNESS (finding 3). A confirm is fresh (emits) only if this
 *      listener observed the Claim PENDING while mounted; a Claim already confirmed
 *      at first sight is baselined as history. This is the key discriminator, not a
 *      first-snapshot latch — so a confirm that becomes visible only on RECONNECT
 *      (the offline-but-open case) still emits, while only a confirm that landed
 *      while the app was FULLY CLOSED is the accepted residual.
 *   4. UID-KEYED PERSISTENCE (finding 4). The working state lives in module scope
 *      keyed by uid (`getConfirmState`, mirroring the #110 pending queue), so an
 *      account switch PARKS held work (including a roster-held first_bingo) and a
 *      switch-back resumes it rather than baselining the now-confirmed Claim away.
 *
 * Exactly-once and no-false-singleton are preserved by COMPOSITION: the writers'
 * deterministic doc ids (`${uid}-bingo` / `${uid}-blackout` / the `first_bingo`
 * singleton) are create-only and immutable, so a live edge that also posts the same
 * win makes this emit a denied/skipped no-op; and the ceremonial First-to-BINGO
 * applies the SAME roster gate the live path does, so a confirm racing another
 * Player's live first-BINGO is suppressed-or-correct — never a false singleton.
