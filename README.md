# Gay Cruise Bingo

A live, multiplayer bingo web app (PWA) to play with your friends on a gay cruise. Sign in, get a randomized card of things that might happen on the sailing, and mark them off as they go down — with a shared leaderboard, party themes, PWA install, and printed cards as the offline fallback.

**Live:** https://gaycruisebingo.web.app · **Setup & runbook:** [`docs/app/README.md`](docs/app/README.md)

## The game

- A randomized 5×5 card dealt from a community-editable prompt pool; the free center square is always marked.
- Honor-system marking with BINGO + blackout detection and a live leaderboard (client-sorted in Phase 0).
- Google sign-in with an 18+ acknowledgment, eight party themes, GA4, and a static share image.
- **Phase 1** (scaffolded, not yet deployed): a photo/audio proof system with a live feed, an admin moderation console with Cloud Vision flagging, verified-claim mode, App Check, and dynamic Playwright-rendered OG share images — designed to land as live updates during the sailing. See [`docs/app/phase-1-deploy.md`](docs/app/phase-1-deploy.md).

## Stack

Vite + React 18 + TypeScript (strict) · Firebase (Auth · Firestore · Storage · Hosting · Analytics) · `vite-plugin-pwa` · Cloud Functions + a Cloud Run OG renderer (Phase 1).

## Quick start

The full setup — env, seeding, deploy, and custom domain — lives in the **[app guide](docs/app/README.md)**. The short version:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local     # fill from `firebase apps:sdkconfig WEB` — see app guide §2
npm install
npm run dev                    # local dev at http://localhost:5173
npm test                       # game-logic unit tests
npm run typecheck              # tsc --noEmit
```

Deploys go through `op-firebase-deploy` (1Password-backed service-account impersonation; never `firebase login` / `firebase deploy` directly) — see app guide §5 and [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md).
